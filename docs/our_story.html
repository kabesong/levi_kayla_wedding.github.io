											<h2>It was a January day in Boston</h2>
										</header>
											<p>and Kayla clutched her reusable mug with one hand as her eyebrow rose to accompany the grin on her face. On a beeline for the free coffee, an opportunity to speak in person aligned as the constant swarm of groupies around him had finally dissipated. "Levi Cowan, as someone who studies atmospheric science is it not hypocritical to use single-use cups? The climate <i>is</i> changing you know." Levi was taken back as the words "NO WEAK COFFEE" on a black aluminum mug were shoved in his face. "Here we go" he thought to himself, as he worried what he was getting himself into. The two were attendeding the American Meteorological Society conference and the morning break was near over.</p>
										<header>
											<h7>They originally met on Hinge,</h7>
										</header>	
											<p>a dating app, a month ago where they exchanged numbers, texting here and there as Levi was in the process of moving to Miami where she was currently residing. Kayla had immediately decided to put him in the friend zone as "she would not be known as the one who broke Levi Cowan's heart to the entire weather community". But the seeds were planted and both parties were intrigued regardless of popularity and politics. 
											Nonetheless treading carefully, their paths didn't cross at the conference again until one fate-filled moment Kayla decided to deviate from her partner in crime, Kelsey, to get a jump on hanging her poster. As she strut through the empty exhibition hall, she heard her name, turned, and was struck with overwhelming senses. It was as if lightning just tapped her in the middle of her chest, leaving her near breathless and at a loss for words.</p>
										<header>
											<h7>It was the first time Levi called her name</h7>
										</header>
											<p>and why and how he was there in this moment we will leave to fate. All words from that conversation are lost forever as Kayla "blacked out", knowing in this moment, he was the one. If you know Levi, he is much more careful and it took some time for him to conclude Kayla was the one. But, the moment did involve a sunset on a balcony overlooking the Miami skyline...and one of Kayla's <i>signautre</i> dinner recipies. They learned they were perfect for each other. Regardless of his fame he was humble and regardless of her passion for the environment she was suprisingly moderate. 
											They also both shared a mutual passion for El Monteray Chicken and Cheese Taquitos from Costco (which they eat together every Friday). </p>
										<header>
											<h7>Their first kiss was</h7>
										</header>	
											<p>that following Valentine's Day after Kayla's Anti-Valentine's Day gathering where everyone was encouraged to wear black and rebel against social construct. They had typical dates to Ikea (a 500 Days of Summer vibe where, contrary to Levi's beliefs, Kayla picked out the couch they still own), the beach, and Barnes and Nobel. It was March, 2020 and they were on their way to supper when Levi brought up a serious virus that we should all be concerned about. Kayla's immediate thoughts were "OH NO THIS CANNOT BE HAPPENING, things were going so well and NOW I find out this guy is khook! A global pandemic, what is this The Walking Dead?!"
												 Well, a global pandemic <i>did</i> occur and the worries Kayla had on Levi's stability were quickly dissolved. They began quarantining together which molded into living together. Eventually they moved to Hawai'i for Levi's work where they live happily ever present.</p>
										<header>
											<h7>What the future holds</h3>
										</header>
											<p>for our loving couple is a dice roll. They intend to depart Hawai'i within five years but have not a clue where they will land. All they know is that they have each other to go through life's rollercoasters with. In atmospheric science, we breakdown the total state of the atmosphere into the "mean" or "stable" state and the "eddy" or "chaotic" state. The stable state is represented by placing an overbar above the variable and the chaotic state variable gets an apostrophe. That is why you'll see our names represented as such, we balance each other like yin and yang, stability and chaos, taking on everything from weak coffee to global pandemics, hand in hand.</p>
