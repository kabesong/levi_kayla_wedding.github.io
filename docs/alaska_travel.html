						<h2><strong>Alaska Awaits...</strong></h2>
						<p>We are thrilled to provide you with the perfect excuse to visit one of our country's most beautiful states. If you are making the journey, we thank you for the effort because it will be nothing short of an adventure. On this page you'll find as much as we can offer to help you get the most of it.</p>

											<h3>Accommodations</h3>
										</header>
										<p>A room block is reserved at Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge. It is two miles south of downtown Talkeetna and ~20 minutes to our venue which is 15 miles south of Talkeetna. Other places such as AirBnb's are availble, however free transportation to and from the wedding will be provided from the lodge only. The lodge also offers a shuttle to downtown Talkeetna. Call here: 907-733-9500 to reserve your spot.</p>
										<header>
											<h3>Getting to Alaska</h3>
											<p>We strongly do NOT reccomend Alaskan Airlines. They are having trouble with pilots and have cancelled three of our last five flights. If you can, try to avoid! We do however, reccommend breaking up the trip if you have the resources. A one way trip to Alaska from Pittsburgh is a minumum of 10 hours! Some ideas for pit stops include: Seattle, Las Vegas, and Vancouver.</p>

											<h3>Getting to Talkeetna</h3>
											<p>The wedding will be held 2 hours north of Anchorage and 4.5 south of Fairbanks. We reccommend flying into Anchorage renting a car, taking the Alaskan Railroad, or hiring a shuttle service. <a href="https://turo.com" target="_blank">Turo</a> is a car rental service analogous to AirBnb and tends to be much cheaper than conventional car rental services. We've used it multiple times with no issues. During winter, the train route avilable is the Aurora Winter Train. This route may have some odd departure dates, so if you are interested in the train, plan accordingly. Two shuttle services availble in March include <a href="https://talkeetnatrip.com/" target="_blank"> Talkeetna Trip</a> and <a href="https://denalioverland.com/" target="_blank"> Denali Overland Transportation</a>. Just an idea to weigh in your cost benefit analysis. Unfortunatley, private dog sled charters are not available to take you from Anchorage to Talkeetna, but small plane charters are!</p>

											<h3>Alaska Travel Information</h3>
											<p>Tourism is second to oil in Alaska's economy. That being said, they have incredible resources to help plan your Alaskan vacation because let's be honest, most of you aren't coming JUST to see us get hitched. Two websites are reccommend: <a href="https://www.alaska.org/" target="_blank">Alaska.org</a> and <a href="https://www.travelalaska.com/" target="_blank"> TravelAlaska.org</a>. The latter even has a FREE Alaskan travel guide mailed from Santa's workshop. We recognize that traveling to Alaska in March is off-season from the typical summer tourism season. However, travel prices are much cheaper in March, there are fewer mosquitos, and it will be dark by 9:30pm, giving you a chance to see the Northern Lights. Be sure to pack your snow boots.</p>

											<h3>Favorite Talkeetna Spots (so far)</h3>
											<p>We've only been to Talkeetna once, but we did have some pretty amazing pizza while there at Mountain High Pizza Pie. We reccommend hitting this spot up ~30-90 minutes after visiting High Expedition just down the road. We personally felt that Denali Brew Pub was overrated with the Fairview Inn providing a nice dive-bar local vibe. Flying Squirrel Cafe was our brunch spot, it did not dissapoint! It is located between the venue and the lodge south of town. They will also be making our wedding cake :).</p>
